It is, therefore, affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the ALAS2-2023-2050 advisory.

  - In the Linux kernel through 6.3.1, a use-after-free in Netfilter nf_tables when processing batch requests     can be abused to perform arbitrary read and write operations on kernel memory. Unprivileged local users     can obtain root privileges. This occurs because anonymous sets are mishandled. (CVE-2023-32233)

  - get_sort_by_table in MariaDB before 10.6.2 allows an application crash via certain subquery uses of ORDER     BY. (CVE-2021-46657)

  - MariaDB before 10.7.2 allows an application crash because it does not recognize that     SELECT_LEX::nest_level is local to each VIEW. (CVE-2021-46659)

  - MariaDB through 10.5.9 allows an application crash in find_field_in_tables and find_order_in_list via an     unused common table expression (CTE). (CVE-2021-46661)

  - MariaDB through 10.5.13 allows a ha_maria::extra application crash via certain SELECT statements.
    (CVE-2021-46663)

  - MariaDB before 10.6.2 allows an application crash because of mishandling of a pushdown from a HAVING     clause to a WHERE clause. (CVE-2021-46666)

  - MariaDB before 10.6.5 has a sql_lex.cc integer overflow, leading to an application crash. (CVE-2021-46667)
